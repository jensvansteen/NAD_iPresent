Its code is publicly available on GitHub, and the framework itself has been released under the Apache 2.0 license. The first noticeable thing about Kitura is the company responsible for it. IBM has been actively involved in Swift development since its inception (see the famous article from Mike Gilfix, Vice President, Process Transformation @ IBM, dated 22 September 2016, which deemed Swift a language ready for enterprise purposes). It looks like it is an important niche for IBM, which promises further improvements and new functionalities.",

At some point, the framework gained a sponsor, nodesagency.com, which allowed its two main developers to begin working full-time. Despite that, theyâ€™re not planning to change the license in the future. Vapor's primary objective was to speed up API development in an environment that Cocoa developers are already familiar with, and it is believed to be the primary course for Vapor. With the recent release of version 2.4.3, Vapor is gradually evolving into a very flexible and performant framework, which makes it a very interesting prospect for the future. It's on the verge of becoming the most popular server-side Swift framework with 12471 stars on GitHub, only 142 fewer than Perfect.",
